\MYTITLE{Laboratory Assignment Eight: Understanding and Releasing Real-World Software}
\MYHEADERS{Laboratory Assignment Eight}{Due: November 13, 2015}

\section*{Introduction}

Throughout the semester, you have learned about the phases of the software development lifecycle and both the software
tools and the non-cognitive skills that are needed to support the creation of high-quality software in each of these
phases. Yet, none of the past laboratory assignments required you to deliver a programming systems product to an
external customer. In this laboratory assignment, you will gain experience in working with and understanding a large,
real-world software system created by an external customer who wants the program to be released to GitHub under a free
and open-source license. Additionally, you will practice applying tools that characterize software (e.g., JDepend and
JavaNCSS) to a large existing system. You and your team members will also explore both the issues related to effective
technology transfer and ways to improve the quality of a software system's documentation.

\begin{enumerate}
    \itemsep0em
    \item A description of and justification for your team's chosen organization, roles, and tool support
    \item A document that clearly explains the meaning of JDepend's design quality metrics
    \item A document that clearly explains the meaning of the metrics calculated by JavaNCSS
    \item An analysis of the values of all the relevant metrics for two previously implemented systems
    \item An analysis of the values of all the relevant metrics for the two open-source systems
    \item Modified implementation artifacts of your chosen systems (e.g., build system and source code)
    \item The slides of the presentation that you will give at the start of the next laboratory session

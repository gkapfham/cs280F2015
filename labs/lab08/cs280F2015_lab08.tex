Throughout the semester, you have learned about the phases of the software development lifecycle and both the software
tools and the non-cognitive skills that are needed to support the creation of high-quality software in each of these
phases. Yet, none of the past laboratory assignments required you to deliver a programming systems product to an
external customer. In this laboratory assignment, you will gain experience in working with and understanding a large,
real-world software system created by an external customer who wants to release it to GitHub under a free and
open-source license. Additionally, you will use tools, like JDepend and JavaNCSS, to characterize to a large existing
system. You and your team members will also explore both the issues related to effective technology transfer and the
ways to improve the quality of a software system's documentation. Finally, you will learn more about the licensing of
free and open-source software.

\begin{enumerate}
    \itemsep0em
    \item A description of and justification for your team's chosen organization, roles, and tool support
    \item A document that clearly explains the meaning of JDepend's design quality metrics
    \item A document that clearly explains the meaning of the metrics calculated by JavaNCSS
    \item An analysis of the values of all the relevant metrics for two previously implemented systems
    \item An analysis of the values of all the relevant metrics for the two open-source systems
    \item Modified implementation artifacts of your chosen systems (e.g., build system and source code)
    \item The slides of the presentation that you will give at the start of the next laboratory session
